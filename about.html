        <p>Grand Hotel Bucharest is the symbol of the 5 * hotels in Romania, being the country's first skyscraper and positioned in the heart of Bucharest Town Center.</p>
        <p>Since 1971 the hotel is part of the Romanian National Cultural Heritage</p>
       <h3>Urban History</h3>
        <p>The construction of this groundbreaking project in a communist era lasted 3 years. It was the first luxury hotel in Romania, designed to become a reference for the country. During that time, the University Square was home to numerous shops and breweries. They had to be demolished to built the hotel and the Romanian National Theater.</p>
        <h3>Iconic Hotel</h3>
        <p>Due to its ultracentral location, the hotel has witnessed important events over the years. The University Square has become a preferred public gathering place for Romanians. Its rooms and apartments welcomed famous guests, presidents of states, sportsmen, royals and important businessmen. It has also served as a location for several movie projects and televisions.</p>
